# Features + Support

## Macro

- An ESP Arduino compatible C++ library for creating mesh networks as defined in [defining_mesh_network_for_esp8266.md](defining_mesh_network_for_esp8266) w/ doxygen inline documentation and plenty of examples.
- At least one example project using this ESP Arduino Mesh Network library.

## Micro

The ESP8266 Mesh Network Library will be built at a high-level on the [OSI Model](http://blog.buildingautomationmonthly.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/OSI-Model.png) (application?) on top of the existing 802.11 Wifi spec.
