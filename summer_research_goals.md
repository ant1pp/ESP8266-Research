# Summer Research Goals

- Fall workshop (1- or 2-day) to show folks how to do something interesting with the ESP8266 + a battery. Think... Mesh networks, ad-hoc, etc... "ESP for Arduino Users"
- Focused on making groups of ESPs talk to each other in a mesh network type of way
- JST connectors (sparkfun)
- "Intro to mobile mesh ESP arduino-style"
- Provide a functional ESP breakout (or integrated board) that supports our style
	- power management
	- i/o
	- disk storage
	- Lithium polymer battery

Todo:
